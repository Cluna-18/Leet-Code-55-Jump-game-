#Description of project 
The prolbem I had chosen for my final project is LeetCode 55, "Jump Game". In this problem, we are given an interger array nums. We are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array
represents your maxmimum jump length at that position. 
Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
